This project consists of 3 modules: Employer Module, Employee Module, Backend (API). Developed in Xamarin, it is targeted at iOS and Android devices. Employers can register a company account, and create their Employees and then allot them Jobs. Employees get notified via email, and they can download the Employee app for clocking time on their jobs. The employee location also gets recorded.
Employers can monitor the time spent by various employees/contractors on each job, total hours clocked by each employee, and also the geographic locations of the employees while working on the job.
